# Advance Search Form Reset Implementation

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Updated Navbar Component
- Modified `openAdvanceSearch()` method to pass `resetForm: true` flag when opening the dialog
- Ensured data is passed as an object with route and resetForm properties
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

### 2. Updated AdvanceSearchFormComponent
- Modified `ngOnInit()` to check for `resetForm` flag in dialog data
- Added conditional form reset logic that only triggers when `resetForm` is true
- Added type checking to handle both string and object data formats for backward compatibility
- Preserved existing `resetChildForm()` method functionality

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- Ensured the component can handle both old string data format and new object format
- Added proper type checking to prevent errors with different data structures

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `src/app/components/navbar/navbar.component.ts`
   - Updated `openAdvanceSearch()` method to pass structured data object
   - Added `resetForm: true` flag to dialog data

2. `src/app/components/dialog-forms/advance-search-form/advance-search-form.component.ts`
   - Enhanced `ngOnInit()` to handle `resetForm` flag
   - Added type checking for data format compatibility
   - Conditional form reset based on flag

## Implementation Details

- **Form Reset Logic**: The form is reset only when `resetForm` flag is explicitly set to `true`
- **Child Component Reset**: Uses existing `resetChildForm()` method with setTimeout for proper initialization
- **Data Structure**: Dialog now receives `{ route: string, resetForm: boolean }` instead of just a string
- **Compatibility**: Handles both old string format and new object format seamlessly

## Testing Recommendations

1. Open advance search form from navbar
2. Verify form fields are cleared/reset when dialog opens
3. Test with different modules/routes to ensure consistent behavior
4. Verify backward compatibility with existing implementations

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All tasks have been successfully implemented and the advance search form now properly resets when opened from the navbar.
